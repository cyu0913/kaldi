en_4622_B_1031 B en_4622_B 274.12 276.74 BUT IT IS NOT MODIFIABLE UNLESS YOU USE A HIGHER VOLTAGE
en_4622_B_1032 B en_4622_B 279.53 284.74 HENCE THE TERM TO BURN A CHIP YOU YOU HAVE THE YOU HAVE A PROGRAMMER WHICH

en_4622_B_1048 B en_4622_B 355.31 361.01 DEPENDING ON THE CHIP YOU KNOW (F-) AND THE STRENGTH OF THE ERASER ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO TWENTY MINUTES YOU ERASE IT
en_4622_B_1049 B en_4622_B 361.70 362.66 YOU KNOW AND THEN YOU HAVE GOT A
en_4622_B_1050 B en_4622_B 363.27 368.92 YOU KNOW DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM TO THE PROGRAMMER AND THEN IT BURNS IT IN SO YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THING
en_4622_B_1051 B en_4622_B 370.10 372.66 CAN TAKE YOU KNOW A BIT OF TIME
en_4622_B_1052 B en_4622_B 373.89 375.85 BUT IT IS A YOU KNOW IT IS A GOOD WAY TO (%HESITATION)

sw_4390_B_1038 B sw_4390_B 274.83 277.73 WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE (%HESITATION) A LITTLE ARCHAIC
sw_4390_B_1039 B sw_4390_B 284.21 287.77 (QUI-) YEAH IT SHOULD BE QUICK AND PAINLESS AND (%HESITATION) (I-)
sw_4390_B_1040 B sw_4390_B 290.96 297.21 WELL AS OPPOSED TO (JU-) YOU KNOW CHOPPING OFF FINGERS AND WATCHING SOMEBODY BLEED TO DEATH (S-) I MEAN YES SUFFERING IS (%HESITATION)
sw_4484_A_1000 A sw_4484_A 5.49 7.73 YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY CHILDREN YET
sw_4484_A_1001 A sw_4484_A 12.54 27.52 WELL I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND I HAVE USED VARIOUS DIFFERENT KINDS OF DAYCARE OVER THE YEARS (%HESITATION) I THINK ACTUALLY THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND GOOD DAYCARE IS WHEN YOUR BABY IS VERY YOUNG
sw_4484_A_1002 A sw_4484_A 27.52 35.79 (%HESITATION) BECAUSE THEY CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT IS GOING ON THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAD WAS WHEN I WAS WORKING
sw_4484_A_1003 A sw_4484_A 35.79 39.89 WHEN MY (%HESITATION) OLDEST CHILD WAS A BABY
sw_4484_A_1004 A sw_4484_A 39.89 48.92 AND I THOUGHT AND I (JUS-) I USED THE LADY NEXT DOOR TO ME AND YOU KNOW IT WAS CLOSE-BY AND IT WAS CONVENIENT AND HE ALWAYS CAME HOME CLEAN AND WHAT HAVE YOU
sw_4484_A_1005 A sw_4484_A 48.92 58.14 BUT I DISCOVERED THAT HER WAY OF HANDLING CONFLICTS BETWEEN LITTLE KIDS ONCE THEY STARTED CRAWLING AND STUFF WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I WANTED
sw_4484_A_1006 A sw_4484_A 58.14 64.27 FOR MY SON SHE ALWAYS INTERFERED AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU HAVE (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION)
sw_4484_A_1007 A sw_4484_A 64.27 70.55 YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF KIDS AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ALL TAKEN CARE OF AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU CANNOT LET
sw_4484_A_1008 A sw_4484_A 70.55 73.47 THINGS ESCALATE BUT
sw_4484_A_1009 A sw_4484_A 73.47 79.54 SHE WOULD DEPRIVE THE ENVIRONMENT IN ORDER FOR THE KIDS NOT TO FIGHT AND THEN JUST STICK THEM IN FRONT OF THE T V
sw_4484_A_1010 A sw_4484_A 79.54 86.86 AND I (I-) YOU KNOW AND I DID NOT DISCOVER THAT UNTIL LATER ON AND BUT IT WAS SUMMER I DECIDED TO QUIT WORKING ANYWAY BUT
sw_4484_A_1011 A sw_4484_A 86.86 98.62 I DECIDED THAT ACTUALLY (THE-) THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND DAYCARE IS UP TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD MAYBE FROM SIX WEEKS TO SIX MONTHS YOU CAN DO IT BUT ONCE YOUR BABY STARTS CRAWLING AND STUFF FROM THEN UNTIL THEY REALLY START TALKING
sw_4484_A_1012 A sw_4484_A 98.62 102.21 IT IS (I-) I FIND THAT IS THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND
sw_4484_A_1013 A sw_4484_A 102.21 106.12 REALLY (COMFORT-) RIGHT NOW THEY ARE SEVEN FIVE AND THREE
sw_4484_A_1014 A sw_4484_A 106.12 107.53 YEAH
sw_4484_A_1015 A sw_4484_A 107.53 112.93 SO BUT THEN ONCE THEY ARE EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD YOU CAN OFTEN FIND GOOD PRESCHOOL
sw_4484_A_1016 A sw_4484_A 112.93 117.36 KINDS OF SITUATIONS BUT I THINK IT IS REAL IMPORTANT TO CHECK
sw_4484_A_1017 A sw_4484_A 117.36 124.54 HOW YOU WANT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS HANDLED AND HOW THE SCHOOL OR DAYCARE DOES IT
sw_4484_A_1018 A sw_4484_A 124.54 131.86 YOU KNOW THE OTHER THINGS TO CHECK THEY ALWAYS TELL YOU YOU KNOW CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS CONTINUITY OF CARE THAT YOUR CHILD IS GONNA
sw_4484_A_1019 A sw_4484_A 131.86 136.02 HAVE SOMEBODY THAT THEY CAN MAKE AN ATTACHMENT TO AND STICK WITH
sw_4484_A_1020 A sw_4484_A 139.69 148.28 WELL I USED SOMETHING SORT OF LIKE A DAYCARE CENTER (%HESITATION) FOR MY YOUNGEST ONE WHEN I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL LAST YEAR
sw_4484_A_1021 A sw_4484_A 148.28 155.42 AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THE SCHOOL AND IT WAS AT A Y W C A
sw_4484_A_1022 A sw_4484_A 155.42 161.38 AND THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAD THERE ACTUALLY WAS THAT THEY
sw_4484_A_1023 A sw_4484_A 161.38 172.96 THEY TRY TO PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF CARE BUT THEY KEPT CHANGING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE PROGRAM YOU KNOW PEOPLE WOULD DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND SO THEIR KIDS WOULD DROP OUT OF THE PROGRAM AND (THEY) (SENT) (ME) (ON) AND SO
sw_4484_A_1024 A sw_4484_A 172.96 177.99 AND SOMEBODY WOULD GET SICK AND THEY WOULD START SHIFTING PEOPLE AROUND FROM ONE ROOM TO THE NEXT
sw_4484_A_1025 A sw_4484_A 177.99 180.25 AND (%HESITATION)
sw_4484_A_1026 A sw_4484_A 180.25 188.64 THAT WAS REALLY TOUGH ON MY SON BECAUSE HE HAD MADE A REAL STRONG ATTACHMENT WITH ONE PARTICULAR CAREGIVER AND THEN THAT ONE
sw_4484_A_1027 A sw_4484_A 188.64 197.37 GOT SWITCHED OUT OF HIS ROOM BUT HE HE ADJUSTED TO IT PRETTY WELL BUT THAT THAT WAS TOUGH ON HIM AND THEY THEY
sw_4484_A_1028 A sw_4484_A 197.37 203.46 DID THEIR BEST NOT TO DO THAT IT WAS JUST THAT YOU KNOW THEY KEPT HAVING (%HESITATION)
sw_4484_A_1029 A sw_4484_A 205.14 213.77 BECAUSE THEY WERE USING STUDENTS TO PROVIDE THE CARE AND BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO WERE USING THE CARE THAT BECAME
sw_4484_A_1030 A sw_4484_A 213.77 218.35 (%HESITATION) MUCH MORE OF AN ISSUE WITH THEM YEAH
sw_4484_A_1031 A sw_4484_A 221.56 227.42 WELL IN OTHER WORDS THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PERSON TAKING CARE OF THEM
sw_4484_A_1032 A sw_4484_A 227.42 232.64 OKAY SO THAT THEY THE SAME FAITH THE SAME AND SEE DIFFERENT PEOPLE EVEN IF
sw_4484_A_1033 A sw_4484_A 232.64 238.74 A DAYCARE CENTER OR A HOME OR A SCHOOL OR SOMETHING HAS A PHILOSOPHY
sw_4484_A_1034 A sw_4484_A 238.74 242.03 AS TO HOW TO DEAL WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF SITUATIONS
sw_4484_A_1035 A sw_4484_A 242.03 247.75 NOT EVERY INDIVIDUAL APPLIES THAT PHILOSOPHY IN THE SAME WAY
sw_4484_A_1036 A sw_4484_A 247.75 251.97 AND SO IT IS NICE FOR KIDS TO HAVE
sw_4484_A_1037 A sw_4484_A 251.97 254.38 A CHANCE TO GET USED TO
sw_4484_A_1038 A sw_4484_A 254.38 256.10 HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN
sw_4484_A_1039 A sw_4484_A 256.10 263.41 SO THAT THEY (THEY-) (NE-) (AN-) THEY HAVE A (CHAN-) THEY CAN START LEARNING TO PREDICT A LITTLE BIT I KNOW REAL LITTLE ONES DO NOT DO VERY MUCH PREDICTING BUT
sw_4484_A_1040 A sw_4484_A 263.41 266.90 THEY SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO SAY (%HESITATION) YES OKAY
sw_4484_A_1041 A sw_4484_A 266.90 271.57 I AM GONNA GET THERE AND THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND IF I DO THIS
sw_4484_A_1042 A sw_4484_A 271.57 277.03 (AN-) THAT IS GONNA (HAPPE-) YOU (KNO-) THEY SHOULD HAVE A WAY TO BE ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN TO THEM
sw_4484_A_1043 A sw_4484_A 277.03 284.50 AND (%HESITATION) IF YOU KEEP CHANGING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE THEN THEY HAVE (NO-) NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO
sw_4484_A_1044 A sw_4484_A 284.50 289.58 AND IT IS HARD ENOUGH ON LITTLE ONES TO BE AWAY FROM THE PARENTS
sw_4484_A_1045 A sw_4484_A 289.58 297.15 (%HESITATION) AND THEN DIFFERENT CHILDREN TOO HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT WAYS OF HANDLING IT ONE THING
sw_4484_A_1046 A sw_4484_A 297.15 298.63 I THINK THAT PARENTS REALLY (D-)
sw_4484_B_1000 B sw_4484_B 0.00 6.45 OKAY (%HESITATION) I PERSONALLY DO NOT KNOW A WHOLE LOT I AM (O-) I AM TWENTY-ONE YEARS OLD AND I DO NOT HAVE ANY CHILDREN
