en_4574_B_1034  OH I WAS GOING TO SAY
en_4574_B_1035  OH THAT'S VERY CHEAP
en_4574_B_1036  AND THEN IF YOU HAVE A PLACE TO STAY
en_4574_B_1037  NOW OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND IT COSTS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY TO JUST WALK AROUND BUT
en_4574_B_1038  SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET ON ONE OF THOSE TRAINS WHERE THEY SHOVE YOU IN
en_4574_B_1039  THEY PUSH YOU IN BEHIND AND BEHIND AND PACK YOU IN

en_4616_A_1016  YEAH
en_4616_A_1017  OH
en_4616_A_1018  YES
en_4616_A_1019  YEAH
en_4616_A_1020 
en_4616_A_1021  YEAH
en_4616_A_1022  MHM
en_4616_A_1023  YEAH
en_4616_A_1024 
en_4616_A_1025  RIGHT
en_4616_A_1026  YEAH
en_4616_A_1027  AND WELL NOW WILL YOU CHECK OUT THE THERMOSTAT FIRST
en_4616_A_1028  MHM AND SO PREFERABLY THAT WILL BE ALL IT ALL IT NEEDS
en_4616_A_1029  ALRIGHT DID I BRING MY TORSION WRENCH UP TO YOU
en_4616_A_1030  OKAY
en_4616_A_1031  OH
en_4616_A_1032  OH
en_4616_A_1033  MHM
en_4616_A_1034  MAYBE YOU CAN TRADE OFF FOR IT THEN
en_4616_A_1035  TRADE
en_4616_A_1036  TRADE THE ONE I BROUGHT UP INTO THE DIAL ONE
en_4616_A_1037  YEAH AND
en_4616_A_1038  YEAH
en_4616_A_1039  MHM
en_4616_A_1040  SO
en_4616_A_1041  MHM
en_4616_A_1042  RIGHT
en_4616_B_1000  AND I LOOKED IT UP TO SEE IF THAT WAS A JOB I FELT LIKE DOING AND
en_4616_B_1001  IT'LL BE THE BIGGEST JOB I'VE EVER DONE ON A CAR BUT I THINK I'LL GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A TRY
en_4616_B_1002  AND
en_4616_B_1003  BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU MAY REMEMBER MY MENTIONING SOME WHILE BACK THAT I WAS PREACHING IN ALASKA BACK IN JANUARY
en_4616_B_1004  AND MAKING A LONG STORY SHORT THROUGH THE COURSE OF THAT SERVICE
en_4616_B_1005  I BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE I NEEDED TO BE ENGAGED IN OUTRAGE AMONG SOME OF THE ARABIC PEOPLE
en_4616_B_1006  HERE IN THE DETROIT AREA
en_4616_B_1007  AND HAVEN'T KNOW HOW TO START AND HAVE BEEN PRAYING FOR CONTACTS WITH ARABIC PEOPLE
en_4616_B_1008  WELL THROUGH LOOKING FOR THIS CAR I'VE GOT IT
en_4616_B_1009  WHAT HAD ENDED UP HAPPENING IS I WENT OVER TO GET THE VIN NUMBER SUNDAY NIGHT SO I COULD GET MY INSURANCE
en_4616_B_1010  BY
en_4616_B_1011  PHONE YOU KNOW ON ON MONDAY MORNING AND THEN GO OVER AND GET
en_4616_B_1012  THE CAR AND BRING IT HOME
en_4616_B_1013  AND WHILE WE WERE TALKING I SAID WHAT COUNTRY ARE YOU FROM AND HE SAID LEBANON
en_4616_B_1014  AND SO I SAID TO HIM
en_4616_B_1015  I SAID PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE WHAT MAKE AMERICA GREAT THE IMMIGRANT
en_4616_B_1016  AND KNOW
en_4616_B_1017  HE SAID HE SAID THAT IN EIGHTEEN YEARS OF LIVING HERE NO ONE HAD EVER SAID THAT TO HIM
en_4616_B_1018  THAT ALL HE'D HEARD WAS YOU GUYS COME OVER HERE YOU TAKE ALL OUR MONEY
en_4616_B_1019  HE SAYS YEAH HE SAYS WE TAKE MONEY HE SAYS WE TAKE THEM FROM THE JOBS WHERE WE'RE WORKING
en_4616_B_1020  HE SAYS JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE WHO WORKS
en_4616_B_1021  SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF HOSTILITY IN DETROIT TOWARD THE ARABIC PEOP-
en_4616_B_1022  AND OH SO IN ANY CASE THROUGH THAT REMARK WHAT HAPPENED IS WHEN I WENT OVER THERE ON MONDAY
en_4616_B_1023  HE SAID HE WAS VERY EMBARRASSED HE DIDN'T HAVE THE TITLE
en_4616_B_1024  AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS HE'S BEEN RUNNING A COLLISION SHOP SO ABOUT A MONTH AGO HE HAD GONE OVER TO AN AUCTION TO BUY A CAR FOR HIS WIFE
en_4616_B_1025  AND HE HAD BOUGHT THIS VOLVO
en_4616_B_1026  AND THEN IT HAD A MECHANICAL PROBLEM AND HE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO TRY TO MESS WITH IT
en_4616_B_1027  IT ONE MECHANIC SAID IT WAS THE HEAD GASKET ONE SAID IT IS THE THERMOSTAT
en_4616_B_1028  AND HE SAID IF IT'S JUST THE THERMOSTAT THEN I'M GETTING A CAR THAT NEEDS ALMOST NO WORK
en_4616_B_1029  FOR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS HE'S SELLING IT TO ME BASICALLY FOR WHAT HE'S GOT IN IT
en_4616_B_1030  AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING HE DOESN'T WANT TO WORK ON THE CAR
en_4616_B_1031  AND
en_4616_B_1032  SO SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED BUT MEANWHILE THE TITLE IS TIED UP IN LANSING
en_4616_B_1033  BECAUSE IT'S A THEFT RECOVERY
en_4616_B_1034  SO THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAD AUCTIONED IT YOU KNOW AND HE'S BEEN DRIVING IT FOR A MONTH
en_4616_B_1035  BUT YOU KNOW TO REGISTER IT IS ONE THING BUT TO HAVE THE TITLE IN YOUR HAND IS ANOTHER
en_4616_B_1036  SO HE SAID THAT IT IT COULD BE AS MUCH AS TWO MORE WEEKS BEFORE HE GETS IT
en_4616_B_1037  OR IT COULD ARRIVE IN THE MAIL TODAY
en_4616_B_1038  BUT MEANWHILE HE WAS SO EMBARRASSED ABOUT THAT WHOLE THING HE HAD ME IN I HAD COFFEE WITH HIM
en_4616_B_1039  I ASKED HIM WHERE TO BUY PINE NUTS WE'D BEEN TO A FEW OF THE ARABIC RESTAURANTS HERE IN TOWN AND DEBBIE'S TAKEN A LIKING TO PINE NUT
en_4616_B_1040  SO HIS WIFE ENDED UP GIVING US A BIG BAG OF PINE NUT
en_4616_B_1041  AND
en_4616_B_1042  YOU KNOW PLUS YOU KNOW WE KNOW WHERE TO GET THEM NOW
en_4616_B_1043  PLUS THEY WANT TO GET TOGETHER AND ALL HAVE DINNER TOGETHER
en_4616_B_1044  AND HE SEEMS TO BE A MUSLIM THOUGH HE WAS TALKING MORE LIKE A HINDU
en_4616_B_1045  HE SAID ALL ROADS LEAD TO THE SAME GOD
en_4616_B_1046 
en_4616_B_1047  CLASSIC HINDUISM
en_4616_B_1048  SO IN ANY CASE
en_4616_B_1049  IT'S IT'S TURNED OUT TO BE NOT JUST ONE BUT TWO ANSWERS TO PRAYER
en_4616_B_1050  YOU KNOW WITH A BIT OF A DELAY THROWN IN BUT
en_4616_B_1051  I'M NOT REAL ANXIOUS ABOUT THAT
en_4616_B_1052  FRANKLY BY THE TIME I GET THE CAR PROBABLY THE HEAT WAVE WILL BREAK AND IT WON'T BE SO BAD WORKING ON IT
en_4616_B_1053  OH YEAH
en_4616_B_1054  WELL IF IT DOES NEED A HEAD GASKET IT'S
en_4616_B_1055  I I LOOKED IT UP IN VOLVO AND IT LOOKS LIKE VOLVO'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE EASIEST CARS THERE IS TO CHANGE A HEAD GASKET ON
en_4616_B_1056  YEAH
en_4616_B_1057  YEAH BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET GET ONE THAT'S BETTER CALIBRATED
en_4616_B_1058  BECAUSE I'M
en_4616_B_1059  IT IT'S JUST SOMETHING WHERE
en_4616_B_1060  THEY THEY MAKE A KIND WHERE YOU SET A DIAL AND IT CLICKS AND SO ON
en_4616_B_1061  I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO HAVE REAL PRECISION IF I
en_4616_B_1062  WELL
en_4616_B_1063  I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KNOW I MEAN
en_4616_B_1064  I'VE NEVER HEARD OF TRADING TOOLS BUT
en_4616_B_1065  WELL IN YOU KNOW UNLESS IT WAS WITH A A PERSON BUT
en_4616_B_1066  BUT
en_4616_B_1067  YEAH THE OTHER ONE IS FINE FOR THINGS LIKE SETTING THE WHEEL BEARINGS AND THAT KIND OF THING
en_4616_B_1068  BUT I'M I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE REAL PRECISION ON
en_4616_B_1069  ON -ED
en_4616_B_1070  BUT THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS IF I'M BUYING OH FOUR TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR CAR FOR
en_4616_B_1071  TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND I HAVE TO GO OUT AND SPEND FORTY DOLLARS ON A WRENCH I'M NOT REALLY GOING TO WORRY ABOUT IT
en_4622_A_1000  OKAY
en_4622_A_1001 
en_4622_A_1002  WHAT DO THOSE COST
en_4622_A_1003  I SEE
en_4622_A_1004 
en_4622_A_1005  UH-HUH
en_4622_A_1006  AND WERE YOU TELLING ME ONCE THAT YOU HAD AN ELECTRONIC NEWS SERVICE
en_4622_A_1007  THROUGH YOUR COMPUTER
en_4622_A_1008  WHAT WAS THE OTHER THING YOU SAID
en_4622_A_1009  EPROM
en_4622_A_1010  WHAT WHAT IS THAT
en_4622_A_1011  MHM
en_4622_A_1012  OH
en_4622_A_1013 
en_4622_A_1014  MHM
en_4622_A_1015  MHM
en_4622_A_1016 
en_4622_A_1017  MHM
en_4622_A_1018  MHM
en_4622_A_1019 
en_4622_A_1020  MHM
en_4622_B_1000  KID OF WEIRD BUT
en_4622_B_1001  THOUGH I MIGHT GET ON TO THE NET THAT WAY
en_4622_B_1002  AND
en_4622_B_1003  AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF IF THAT ADDRESS BECOMES AVAILABLE
en_4622_B_1004  THERE'S ALSO SUPPOSEDLY YOU KNOW A MAGAZINE LISTING ALL OF THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS HERE AND
en_4622_B_1005  DENVER WHICH I NEED TO STILL LOOK OVER
en_4622_B_1006  GENERALLY RUNS ABOUT
en_4622_B_1007  YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD OF THINGS AS LOW AS TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH
en_4622_B_1008  ACTUALLY THERE'S THIS ONE PLACE
en_4622_B_1009  THAT IS BULLETIN BOARD
en_4622_B_1010  WHICH ALLOWS THEY'RE
en_4622_B_1011  I GUESS TRYING TO ATTRACT NEW PEOPLE SO IT'S LIKE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS
en_4622_B_1012  FOR THE FIRST YEAR
en_4622_B_1013  BUT IN GENERAL I THINK THE THEORY IS ACCESS PROVIDERS GENERALLY CHARGE ABOUT TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH
en_4622_B_1014  AND THE PRICE CAN GO UP FROM THERE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH
en_4622_B_1015  VOLUME YOU EXPECT TO BE USING
en_4622_B_1016  LAST YEAR IT WAS LIKE SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A SLIP ACCOUNT WHICH IS LIKE THIS
en_4622_B_1017  LIKE YOU KNOW DEDICATED LINE
en_4622_B_1018  BETWEEN YOUR COMPUTER AND THEIRS
en_4622_B_1019  NOW THERE'S I THINK THEY'RE PRICE HAS GONE DOWN TO ABOUT FORTY DOLLARS A MONTH
en_4622_B_1020  SO
en_4622_B_1021  I STILL NEED TO DO SOME MORE LOOKING THESE ARE ALL JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW
en_4622_B_1022  HEARSAY
en_4622_B_1023  YEAH I USED TO R- HAVE ZENEC WHICH IS SANTA CRUISE OPERATIONS VERSION OF UNEC
en_4622_B_1024  INSTALLED ON MY TWO EIGHTY SIX AND
en_4622_B_1025  IT HAS YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN RECONFIGURED IT BACK TO A DOS MACHINE WE USE IT FOR
en_4622_B_1026  YOU KNOW BURNING EPROM'S AND YOU KNOW DOING KIND OF THE LOW LEVEL
en_4622_B_1027  DEVELOPMENT KINDS OF THINGS ON IT
en_4622_B_1028  EPROM PROGRAMMING
en_4622_B_1029  YEAH IT'S
en_4622_B_1030  ERASABLE PROGRAMMABLE READ ONLY MEMORY
en_4622_B_1031  BUT IT'S NOT MODIFIABLE UNLESS YOU USE A HIGHER VOLTAGE
en_4622_B_1032  HENCE THE TERM TO BURN A CHIP YOU YOU HAVE THE YOU HAVE A PROGRAMMER WHICH
en_4622_B_1033  HAS A SPECIAL SOCKET THAT YOU DROP THE CHIP INTO AND YOU THEN
en_4622_B_1034  IT THEN RAISES THE VOLTAGE UP TO ABOUT WELL DEPENDING ON THE CHIP ANY ANYWHERE FROM TWELVE TO TWENTY FIVE VOLTS
en_4622_B_1035  NORMAL OPERATING VOLTAGE IS AT FIVE VOLTS
en_4622_B_1036  SO AT THE HIGHER VOLTAGE IT
en_4622_B_1037  I FORGET THE EXACT PHYSICS OF IT BUT YOU END UP KIND OF LIKE AN ETCH A SKETCH YOU KNOW YOU YOU PUT SOME
en_4622_B_1038  YOU YOU YOU BURN ZEROS INTO IT
en_4622_B_1039  IT STARTS OUT BEING ALL ONES AND THEN YOU BURN THE ZEROS IN
en_4622_B_1040  AND THEN YOU
en_4622_B_1041  WITH A EPROM YOU USE ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT TO
en_4622_B_1042  DISLODGE THE ELECTRONS AND THEN YOU KNOW IT IT ERASES IT BACK TO ONE
en_4622_B_1043  AND THEN THERE'S ALSO ELECTRICALLY ERASEABLE WHICH USES ANOTHER
en_4622_B_1044  VOLTAGE TO DISCHARGE THE
en_4622_B_1045  THE MEMORY LOCATION
en_4622_B_1046  SO IT'S KIND OF A
en_4622_B_1047  YOU KNOW IT TAKES ABOUT
en_4622_B_1048  DEPENDING ON THE CHIP YOU KNOW F- AND THE STRENGTH OF THE ERASER ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO TWENTY MINUTES YOU ERASE IT
en_4622_B_1049  YOU KNOW AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A
en_4622_B_1050  YOU KNOW DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM TO THE PROGRAMMER AND THEN IT BURNS IT IN SO YOU KNOW THE WHOLE THING
en_4622_B_1051  CAN TAKE YOU KNOW A BIT OF TIME
en_4622_B_1052  BUT IT'S A YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD WAY TO
en_4622_B_1053  YOU KNOW MAKE CHANGES TO A SYSTEM JUST BY SWAPPING OUT A CHIP
en_4622_B_1054  AND
en_4622_B_1055  YOU KNOW SO WE'VE GOT AN EPROM PROGRAMMER WE'VE GOT A
en_4622_B_1056  PROGRAMMER FOR YOU KNOW MICRO CONTROLLERS WHICH ALSO HAVE EPROM IN THEM
en_4622_B_1057 
en_4622_B_1058  THAT KIND OF THING
en_4622_B_1059  OH ANOTHER THING WE USE IT FOR IS LIKE UPLOADING AND DOWNLOADING PROGRAMS FROM THE H P FORTY EIGHT G
en_4622_B_1060  TO A GRAPHIC CALCULATOR
en_4622_B_1061  PROGRAMMABLE
en_4622_B_1062  IT'S GOOD WE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S CHEAPER TO BUY A AN H P
en_4852_A_1000  UNBELIEVABLE
en_4852_A_1001  YEAH EVERY DAY EVERY DAY EVERY DAY
en_4852_A_1002  OH MY GOODNESS YOU MEAN
en_4852_A_1003  BUT SH-

en_5017_A_1023  IT'S A IT'S A GOOD PLACE BUT JUST TO CUT DOWN ON THE ON THE COMMUTING
en_5017_A_1024  BECAUSE IF I AM AND I'M IN THE RIGHT PLACE I'D ONLY BE LIKE TWO OR THREE MILES FROM THE JOB THAT'S
en_5017_A_1025  WHAT I WOULD LIKE IDEALLY THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE
en_5017_A_1026  I W- WHEN I WHEN I START THERE'S

en_5017_A_1028  THE YOU KNOW THEY THEY WANT LIKE CLOSE TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS
en_5017_A_1029  SO EVERYTHING I NOTICED IS YOU KNOW YOU GO TO THE GROCERY STORE YOU GO TO THE GAS STATION
en_5017_A_1030  YOU KNOW IS A LOT HIGHER
en_5017_A_1031  AND AT LEAST WHAT I WAS DOING LIKE FOR THE SUMMER IS THAT I WAS COMING UP AND
en_5017_A_1032  NEVER BUYING GAS DOWN THERE BUT GETTING IT HERE OR IF I WENT TO LONG ISLAND I'D GET IT THERE WHERE IT'S IT'S CHEAPER AND
en_5017_A_1033  AND THEN I WOULD
en_5017_A_1034  YOU KNOW LOAD UP ON MY GROCERIES AND ANYTHING I WAS GOING TO HAVE I'D BRING DOWN THERE SO I'D KIND OF AVOID IT THAT WAY
en_5017_A_1035  BUT YOU KNOW I I THAT WOULD BE A WHOLE LOT EASIER BUT THEN
en_5017_A_1036  I DON'T KNOW WHENEVER I WOULD GET TO SEE YOU AND MIKE
en_5017_A_1037  I WOULDN'T I'D BE A LOT CLOSER TO YOU

en_5017_A_1040  YOU KNOW I I DON'T KNOW
en_5017_A_1041 
en_5017_A_1042  Y- Y- I I JUST GET THE FEELING THAT
en_5017_A_1043  THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY COME UP TO THIS AREA
en_5017_A_1044  BUT NOT WHERE I AM AS YOU KNOW AS OFTEN SO I
en_5017_A_1045  YEAH AND YOU
en_5017_A_1046  SO I AND THEN OF COURSE WHEN
en_5017_A_1047  JILL COMES HOME LIKE AND SHE'LL BE COMING HOME AT THANKSGIVING
en_5017_A_1048  AND EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE CONGREGATING UP HERE
en_5017_A_1049  SO Y- Y- YOU KNOW IT'S
en_5017_A_1050  IT'S A TOUGH DECISION BUT THEN AS I WAS SAYING ON THE ON THE OTHER HAND
en_5017_A_1051  AS SOON AS I
en_5017_A_1052 
en_5017_A_1053  YEAH I YEAH I KNOW IT SO I I'VE I
en_5017_A_1054  I I'M STUCK HERE AT LEAST THROUGH THROUGH AUGUST
en_5017_A_1055  BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF THE LEASE BUT EVEN EVEN AT THAT I'M I'M NOT
en_5017_A_1056  I'M STUCK HERE BUT I'M TIED IN BUT I'M NOT IF I WANTED TO LEAVE I COULD DO THAT
en_5017_A_1057  I COULD JUST WAIT UNTIL SOMEBODY COMES IN AND
en_5017_A_1058  AND WANTS THE PLACE AND SO I WOULDN'T BE PRESSED TO GO
en_5017_A_1059  AND THEN THE OTHER OPTION THAT I WAS THINKING OF WAS AFTER THE
en_5017_A_1060  AFTER THE CAR IS PAID OFF
en_5017_A_1061  TO GO
en_5017_A_1062  MOVE MY STUFF INTO BEAKMAN AND USE THAT AS A PRIMARY RESIDENCE BUT YET
en_5017_A_1063  BUT THEN LIKE RENT A ROOM DOWN THERE IN THE TOWN I'M I'M WORKING IN

sw_4390_A_1002  OBVIOUSLY IT'D HAVE TO BE I- AN- WE- WHAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE ON IS WHETHER IS WHETHER IT'S RIGHT FOR A CERTAIN CRIMES OR NOT
sw_4390_A_1003 
sw_4390_A_1004  SUCH AS LIKE THE MURDERING OF A COP OR
sw_4390_A_1005  ALO- ALONG THOSE LINES FIR-
sw_4390_A_1006  REHABILITATION OF YEAH

sw_4390_A_1008  RIGHT
sw_4390_A_1009  THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S NO CHANCE OF REHABILITATION BESIDE THE- FACT OF WH- WHAT REHABILITATION ACTUALLY COSTS AND THE M- COST OF KEEPING SOMEONE IN JAIL
sw_4390_A_1010  ON A LIFE SENTENCE AS OPPOSED TO TH- DEATH PENALTY
sw_4390_A_1011  THAT'S ANOTHER THING TO LOOK AT WHA- WHAT THE TAXPAYERS HAVE TO PAY AND THE DIFFERENCE IN COSTS

sw_4390_A_1014  RIGHT AND WE'RE BASICALLY PAYING FOR HIM TO LO- STAY ALIVE

sw_4390_A_1023  NO WHITE COLLAR CRIME DOESN'T EXACTLY FALL INTO IT
sw_4390_A_1024  RIGHT
sw_4390_A_1025  AND RAPE BUT RAPE CASES ARE SO HARD TO PROVE A- AS IT IS
sw_4390_A_1026  UH-HUH
sw_4390_A_1027  AND AND HOW CAN Y- HOW CAN YOU PUT SOMEONE'S LIFE UP AGAINST THAT
sw_4390_A_1028  UM-HUM
sw_4390_A_1029  WHAT ABOUT METHODS OF OF THE DEATH PENALTY
sw_4390_A_1030  WHICH A- WHICH ARE I GUESS
sw_4390_A_1031  OKAY YEAH THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING HERE
sw_4390_A_1032  THE PREFERRED METHOD YEAH
sw_4390_A_1033  I DON'T KNOW I THINK THERE THERE MAY HAVE BE ONE MAY STILL BE ONE OR TWO STATES THAT DO
sw_4390_A_1034 
sw_4390_A_1035  THE GAS CHAMBER IS I KNOW IS OUT
sw_4390_A_1036  GAS IS OUT
sw_4390_A_1037  FIRING SQUAD TH- A BIT AR- EXACTLY YEAH THAT -AT THAT IS A BIT ARCHAIC
sw_4390_A_1038 
sw_4390_A_1039  I MEAN REGARDLESS IT SHOULD BE QUICK AND
sw_4390_A_1040  I HA- YEAH I HATE TO SAY PAINLESS BECAUSE BUT YOU KNOW
sw_4390_A_1041  RIGHT SUFFERING
sw_4390_B_1000  ALL RIGHT JEFF WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
sw_4390_B_1001  UM-HUM UM-HUM
sw_4390_B_1002  WELL I- I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN CRIMES THAT THAT IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY CALLED FOR
sw_4390_B_1003  WELL YES SUCH A- YES ALO- ALONG DEFINITELY ALONG THOSE LINES I- I DON'T HAVE ANY
sw_4390_B_1004  HOW DO I WANT TO SAY THIS I'M NOT INTERESTED IN REHABIL- REIN REHA- REIN- REIN- REHABILITATING OF CERTAIN OF CRIMINALS THAT DO CERTAIN THINGS AND
sw_4390_B_1005  YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE LIKE JEFFREY DAHLMER YOU KNOW KILLING PEOPLE AND MUTILATING THEM AND AND OBVIOUSLY DOING
sw_4390_B_1006  VERY WEIRD THINGS I- I DON'T HAVE ANY I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM GIVING HIM THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT PUNISHMENT AT ALL
sw_4390_B_1007  THERE'S I THINK YOU YOU KNOW IN A SOCIETY YOU HAVE TO DRAW A LINE SOMEWHERE AND SAY HEY IF YOU CROSS THIS LINE THAT'S IT
sw_4390_B_1008  EXACTLY EXACTLY
sw_4390_B_1009  SURE SURE IT COSTS EVERY ONE OF US TO TO SUPPORT THAT PERSON
sw_4390_B_1010  YOU KNOW SHOOT THAT'S I- YOU MAY BE LOCKED UP BUT IT'S IT'S STILL ROOM AND BOARD
sw_4390_B_1011  EXACTLY EXACTLY
sw_4390_B_1012  YEAH I AGREE NOW YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GO AN EYE FOR AN EYE I- I GUESS ON EVERY ON EVERY ASPECT
sw_4390_B_1013  YOU KNOW AND IN IN Y- IT HAS TO BE I THINK YOU HAVE TO DEFINE THAT FAIRLY CAREFULLY
sw_4390_B_1014  SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU'D IT ISN'T AN A- AN A- AN ABUSED THING BUT THE ONE THING THAT
sw_4390_B_1015  THAT IT OUGHT TO BE IS YOU OUGHT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND THERE OUGHT TO BE A TIME FRAME FOR IT TO HAPPEN
sw_4390_B_1016  WELL IN OTHER WORDS YOU PUT SOMEBODY ON ON DEATH ROW AND AND YOU CAN GO ON FOR TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS APPEALING EVERYTHING YOU KNOW THERE OU- THERE OUGHT TO BE YOU KNOW I'M NOT SAYING IT OUGHT TO BE LIKE YOU KNOW TWO WEEKS AND THEN YOU'RE GONE BUT
sw_4390_B_1017  THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME SORT OF VEHICLE TO MAKE IT EXPEDITIOUS
sw_4390_B_1018  YEAH EXACTLY EXACTLY FAIR AND SPEEDY ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LINE I GUESS
sw_4390_B_1019  IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A TOUGH THING TO DECIDE BUT
sw_4390_B_1020  GOODNESS IT'S I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT MUCH MUCH PAST THAT
sw_4390_B_1021  YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE BANK FRAUD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT CERTAINLY DOES NOT DESERVE THE
sw_4390_B_1022  NO NO
sw_4390_B_1023  YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET INTO THINGS LIKE CHILD MOLESTATION AND AND RAPE NOW THAT'S
sw_4390_B_1024  THE- THE- YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT
sw_4390_B_1025  YOU KNOW AGGRAVATED RAPE I WITH DI- I WOULD THINK WOULD HAVE TO YOU'D HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT AS IN THE IN THE DEATH PENALTY RANGE
sw_4390_B_1026  YES EXACTLY EXACTLY
sw_4390_B_1027  I MEAN THAT'S BE ALMOST ONE ONE PERSON'S WORD AGAINST ANOTHER
sw_4390_B_1028  YOU YOU- YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT BUT WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO
sw_4390_B_1029 
sw_4390_B_1030  I GUESS WHAT'S THE IN TEXAS CALLED AGGRAVATED RAPE WHICH IS BASICALLY BRUTAL BEATING TYPE TYPE ATTACK THAT'S
sw_4390_B_1031  I DON'T KNOW THERE- THERE'S CERTAIN CERT- CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THAT THAT
sw_4390_B_1032  I WOULD HAVE TO THINK WOULD WOULD FALL UNDER THAT
sw_4390_B_1033  WELL IN TEXAS WE HAVE LETHAL INJECTION
sw_4390_B_1034  AND I THINK THAT'S IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THE PREFERRED METHOD I DON'T THINK IT I DON'T ANYBODY DOES ELEC- ELECTROCUTION ANYMORE DO THEY
sw_4390_B_1035  YEAH YEAH
sw_4390_B_1036  WELL WHEN WHEN GARY GILMORE GOT WAS EXECUTED IN NEVADA
sw_4390_B_1037  GOSH IT'S PRO- PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT EIGHT- OR TEN YEARS AGO NOW OR EVEN- PROBABLY EVEN FIFTEEN HE WAS IN- YOU KNOW F- PUT IN FRONT OF A IN- PUT IN FRONT OF A FIRING SQUAD
sw_4390_B_1038  WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE A LITTLE ARCHAIC
sw_4390_B_1039  QUI- YEAH IT SHOULD BE QUICK AND PAINLESS AND I-
sw_4390_B_1040  WELL AS OPPOSED TO JU- YOU KNOW CHOPPING OFF FINGERS AND WATCHING SOMEBODY BLEED TO DEATH S- I MEAN YES SUFFERING IS
sw_4484_A_1000  YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN YET
sw_4484_A_1001  WELL I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND I'VE USED VARIOUS DIFFERENT KINDS OF DAYCARE OVER THE YEARS I THINK ACTUALLY THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND GOOD DAYCARE IS WHEN YOUR BABY'S VERY YOUNG
sw_4484_A_1002  BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAD WAS WHEN I WAS WORKING
sw_4484_A_1003  WHEN MY OLDEST CHILD WAS A BABY
sw_4484_A_1004  AND I THOUGHT AND I JUS- I USED THE LADY NEXT DOOR TO ME AND YOU KNOW IT WAS CLOSE-BY AND IT WAS CONVENIENT AND HE ALWAYS CAME HOME CLEAN AND WHAT HAVE YOU
sw_4484_A_1005  BUT I DISCOVERED THAT HER WAY OF HANDLING CONFLICTS BETWEEN LITTLE KIDS ONCE THEY STARTED CRAWLING AND STUFF WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I WANTED
sw_4484_A_1006  FOR MY SON SHE ALWAYS INTERFERED AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU HAVE
sw_4484_A_1007  YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF KIDS AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALL TAKEN CARE OF AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU CAN'T LET
sw_4484_A_1008  THINGS ESCALATE BUT
sw_4484_A_1009  SHE WOULD DEPRIVE THE ENVIRONMENT IN ORDER FOR THE KIDS NOT TO FIGHT AND THEN JUST STICK THEM IN FRONT OF THE T V
sw_4484_A_1010  AND I I- YOU KNOW AND I DIDN'T DISCOVER THAT UNTIL LATER ON AND BUT IT WAS SUMMER I DECIDED TO QUIT WORKING ANYWAY BUT
sw_4484_A_1011  I DECIDED THAT ACTUALLY THE- THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND DAYCARE IS UP TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD MAYBE FROM SIX WEEKS TO SIX MONTHS YOU CAN DO IT BUT ONCE YOUR BABY STARTS CRAWLING AND STUFF FROM THEN UNTIL THEY REALLY START TALKING
sw_4484_A_1012  IT'S I- I FIND THAT'S THE HARDEST TIME TO FIND
sw_4484_A_1013  REALLY COMFORT- RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SEVEN FIVE AND THREE
sw_4484_A_1014  YEAH
sw_4484_A_1015  SO BUT THEN ONCE THEY'RE EIGHTEEN MONTHS OLD YOU CAN OFTEN FIND GOOD PRESCHOOL
sw_4484_A_1016  KINDS OF SITUATIONS BUT I THINK IT'S REAL IMPORTANT TO CHECK
sw_4484_A_1017  HOW YOU WANT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS HANDLED AND HOW THE SCHOOL OR DAYCARE DOES IT
sw_4484_A_1018  YOU KNOW THE OTHER THINGS TO CHECK THEY ALWAYS TELL YOU YOU KNOW CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S CONTINUITY OF CARE THAT YOUR CHILD IS GONNA
sw_4484_A_1019  HAVE SOMEBODY THAT THEY CAN MAKE AN ATTACHMENT TO AND STICK WITH
sw_4484_A_1020  WELL I USED SOMETHING SORT OF LIKE A DAYCARE CENTER FOR MY YOUNGEST ONE WHEN I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL LAST YEAR
sw_4484_A_1021  AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THE SCHOOL AND IT WAS AT A Y W C A
sw_4484_A_1022  AND THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAD THERE ACTUALLY WAS THAT THEY
sw_4484_A_1023  THEY TRY TO PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF CARE BUT THEY KEPT CHANGING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE PROGRAM YOU KNOW PEOPLE'D DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND SO THEIR KIDS WOULD DROP OUT OF THE PROGRAM AND THEY SENT ME ON AND SO
sw_4484_A_1024  AND SOMEBODY WOULD GET SICK AND THEY'D START SHIFTING PEOPLE AROUND FROM ONE ROOM TO THE NEXT
sw_4484_A_1025  AND
sw_4484_A_1026  THAT WAS REALLY TOUGH ON MY SON BECAUSE HE'D MADE A REAL STRONG ATTACHMENT WITH ONE PARTICULAR CAREGIVER AND THEN THAT ONE
sw_4484_A_1027  GOT SWITCHED OUT OF HIS ROOM BUT HE HE ADJUSTED TO IT PRETTY WELL BUT THAT THAT WAS TOUGH ON HIM AND THEY THEY
sw_4484_A_1028  DID THEIR BEST NOT TO DO THAT IT'S JUST THAT YOU KNOW THEY KEPT HAVING
sw_4484_A_1029  BECAUSE THEY WERE USING STUDENTS TO PROVIDE THE CARE AND BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO WERE USING THE CARE THAT BECAME
sw_4484_A_1030  MUCH MORE OF AN ISSUE WITH THEM YEAH
sw_4484_A_1031  WELL IN OTHER WORDS THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PERSON TAKING CARE OF THEM
sw_4484_A_1032  OKAY SO THAT THEY THE SAME FAITH THE SAME AND SEE DIFFERENT PEOPLE EVEN IF
sw_4484_A_1033  A DAYCARE CENTER OR A HOME OR A SCHOOL OR SOMETHING HAS A PHILOSOPHY
sw_4484_A_1034  AS TO HOW TO DEAL WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF SITUATIONS
sw_4484_A_1035  NOT EVERY INDIVIDUAL APPLIES THAT PHILOSOPHY IN THE SAME WAY
sw_4484_A_1036  AND SO IT'S NICE FOR KIDS TO HAVE
sw_4484_A_1037  A CHANCE TO GET USED TO
sw_4484_A_1038  HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN
sw_4484_A_1039  SO THAT THEY THEY- NE- AN- THEY HAVE A CHAN- THEY CAN START LEARNING TO PREDICT A LITTLE BIT I KNOW REAL LITTLE ONES DON'T DO VERY MUCH PREDICTING BUT
sw_4484_A_1040  THEY SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO SAY YES OKAY
sw_4484_A_1041  I'M GONNA GET THERE AND THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND IF I DO THIS
sw_4484_A_1042  AN- THAT'S GONNA HAPPE- YOU KNO- THEY SHOULD HAVE A WAY TO BE ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THEM
sw_4484_A_1043  AND IF YOU KEEP CHANGING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE THEN THEY HAVE NO- NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO
sw_4484_A_1044  AND IT'S HARD ENOUGH ON LITTLE ONES TO BE AWAY FROM THE PARENTS
sw_4484_A_1045  AND THEN DIFFERENT CHILDREN TOO HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT WAYS OF HANDLING IT ONE THING
sw_4484_A_1046  I THINK THAT PARENTS REALLY D-
sw_4484_B_1000  OKAY I PERSONALLY DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT I'M O- I'M TWENTY-ONE YEARS OLD AND I DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN
sw_4484_B_1001  SO BUT I'VE BABY-SAT AND STUFF AND I THINK ABOUT HAVING CHILDREN SO HOW ABOUT YOU
sw_4484_B_1002  UM-HUM
sw_4484_B_1003  OH REALLY

sw_4484_B_1018  RIGHT WHAT OTHER KINDS OF OF THINGS HAVE YOU USED HAVE YOU EVER USED LIKE A DAYCARE CENTER TYPE THING OR
sw_4484_B_1019  UM-HUM
sw_4484_B_1020  OH THAT'S NICE
sw_4484_B_1021  OH

sw_4484_B_1023  WOW
sw_4484_B_1024  UM-HUM
sw_4484_B_1025  WOW SO YOU WOULD- IT SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IS THE CONTINUITY OF CARE WHAT- WHAT DO YOU M- I- MEAN WHEN YOU SAY THAT EX-
sw_4484_B_1026  OH I SEE THAT MAKES SENSE THAT MAKES SE-
sw_4484_B_1027  UM-HUM
sw_4484_B_1028  THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH
sw_4484_B_1029  UM-HUM
sw_4484_B_1030  YEAH
sw_4484_B_1031  UM-HUM
sw_4484_B_1032  UM-HUM
sw_4507_A_1000  RIGHT UM-HUM
sw_4507_A_1001  UH-HUH
sw_4507_A_1002  WELL WE HAVE A BUDGET WE GET PAID EVERY TWO WEEKS AND I HAVE CERTAIN BILLS AT CERTAIN TIMES
sw_4507_A_1003  YOU KNOW I EITHER FIRST OF OR THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH
sw_4507_A_1004  AND I PAY THE BILLS ACCORDING TO THAT AND THEN WHAT I- K- AND THEN I BUDGET LIKE OUR SAVINGS I BUDGET THAT OUT AND DAYCARE I BUDGET THAT OUT BECAUSE I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT

sw_4507_B_1050  YEAH
sw_4507_B_1051  YEAH
sw_4507_B_1052 
sw_4507_B_1053  UM-HUM
sw_4507_B_1054  YES

sw_4507_B_1056 
sw_4507_B_1057  YEAH
sw_4507_B_1058  YEAH
sw_4507_B_1059  BUT YOU BUDGET THE LOAN INTO YOUR
sw_4507_B_1060  WERE YOU DOING THIS BEFORE YOU GOT MARRIED WHEN YOU WERE LIKE WHERE ON YOUR OWN OR MANAGING YOUR OWN MONEY BEFORE YOU GOT MARRIED WERE YOU
sw_4507_B_1061  DOING A BUDGET THEN
sw_4520_A_1000  WELL I USED TO BE A TEACHER AND I THINK THERE ARE MANY THINGS WRONG WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHY I GOT OUT OF TEACHING
sw_4520_A_1001  WELL I THINK THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH DISCIPLINE AND THE CLASSES ARE TOO BIG
sw_4520_A_1002  BECAUSE
sw_4520_A_1003  KIDS JUST GET AWAY WITH TOO MUCH AND THERE'S NOT
sw_4520_A_1004  REALLY THAT MUCH THAT A TEACHER CAN DO BECAUSE
sw_4520_A_1005  THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORRIED ABOUT THE BIG PROBLEMS ABOUT YOU KNOW KIDS BRINGING GUNS TO SCHOOL
sw_4520_A_1006  AND THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO WORRY ABOUT THE P- THE PROBLEMS OF
sw_4520_A_1007  OF MANAGEMENT THAT THEY USED TO BE ABLE TO WORRY ABOUT
sw_4520_A_1008  WELL I THINK N- THE PROBLEM WITH THAT THE PROBLEM I HAD BECAUSE WHEN I WENT INTO TEACHING I DECIDED THAT I WAS JUST GONNA BE YOU KNOW THE PERFECT CREATIVE TEACHER AND
sw_4520_A_1009  MY KIDS WERE GONNA JUST THINK THAT LEARNING WAS FUN AND
sw_4520_A_1010  I WAS TEACHING EIGHTH GRADE
sw_4520_A_1011  YES
sw_4520_A_1012  WELL THIS WAS IN SOUTH CAROLINA
sw_4520_A_1013  BUT ANYWAY THE PROBLEM THAT I HAD
sw_4520_A_1014  WAS MY STUDENTS DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT AND
sw_4520_A_1015  THEY BASICALLY
sw_4520_A_1016  DIDN'T THEY DIDN'T APPRECIATE EVERYTHING I WAS TRYING TO DO FOR THEM BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE
sw_4520_A_1017  LEARNING GAMES ALL THE TIME AND I TRIED TO DO JUST FUN THINGS AND MAKE IT INTERESTING AND DO CREATIVE THINKING
sw_4520_A_1018  JUST ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND THEY JUST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME AND THEY WALKED ALL OVER ME AND I WAS NEVER
sw_4520_A_1019  ABLE TO ESTABLISH ANY KIND OF DISCIPLINE BECAUSE I STARTED OUT BEING TOO NICE
sw_4520_A_1020  WELL SEE THAT'S THE THING IS I DON'T THINK THAT THEY DO RESPECT TEACHERS AND I'M SAYING THAT THAT THAT WELL JUST THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IN MY SCHOOL DIDN'T GIVE ME ANY SUPPORT AND IT'S LIKE AFTER
sw_4520_A_1021  YOU KNOW THAT THE STUDENTS WERE ALREADY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME
sw_4520_A_1022  THEY JUST TOLD ME TO JUST CRACK DOWN AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T SUPPORT ME IN THAT
sw_4520_A_1023  AND THEY JUST TOLD THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT THESE STUDENTS WOULD RESPOND WOULD BE IF I HAD A COMPLETELY STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT AND I WAS MISERABLE
sw_4520_A_1024  DOING THAT
sw_4520_B_1000  UM-HUM
sw_4520_B_1001  WELL YO- WONDER WHAT WERE THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU FOUND IN PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS
sw_4520_B_1002  YEAH
sw_4520_B_1003  WE- WE- I- I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT I- IF YOU START CONCERNING YOURSELF MORE WITH DISCIPLINE I THINK
sw_4520_B_1004  I THINK TEACHERS' MAIN GOAL SHOULD BE MORE INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT DISCIPLINE IS GETTING T- TH- STUDENTS OR YOU KNOW KIDS INTERESTED IN LEARNING BECAUSE AS I CAN RECALL WHERE I WENT TO GO GO- TO SCHOOL
sw_4520_B_1005  MOST OF THE TEACHERS WERE JUST BASICALLY BENT ON EITHER TRYING TO DISCIPLINE YOU AND THEN FORCE YOU TO GO THROUGH THIS MATERIAL AND SHOW NO REALLY INTEREST I MEAN IN TO MAKING IT INTERESTING OR FUN FUN AND AND SCHOOL WERE TWO OXYMORON TYPE OF WORD
sw_4520_B_1006  AND I THINK THAT WAS BASICALLY THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY WERE T- MORE INTERES- THEY BUILT UP THIS TYPE OF
sw_4520_B_1007  I DON'T KNOW THIS MIGHT NOT BE IN YOUR CASE BUT AT LEAST WHERE I WENT TO SCHOOL A SUPERIORITY COMPLEX WHERE THEY HAD TO BE ALWAYS MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THEIR STUDENTS AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR STUDENTS THEY FELT MORE INTIMIDATED
sw_4520_B_1008  WHEN PEOPLE WOULD ASK YOU KNOW QUESTIONS THAT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES SO THEN RATHER THAN
sw_4520_B_1009  DOING THIS THEY WOULD EITHER YOU KNOW RIDICULE THE STUDENT OR TELL THEM TO SHUT UP OR YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT WHAT WE'RE COVERING WE'RE DOING THIS AND SO CERTAIN KIDS WHO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING DIFFERENT AVENUES WHERE JUST BASICALLY SHUNTED BECAUSE
sw_4520_B_1010  YOU KNOW THERE- YOU KNOW IT- THEY WERE ALL MORE CONCERNED THAT EVERYBODY FOLLOWS ALONG A CERTAIN PATH ALTHOUGH I AGREE THAT DISCIPLINING IS IMPORTANT
sw_4520_B_1011  -ND ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE ARE IN- IN DIFFERENT AREAS WHERE KIDS ARE ALREADY GROWN TO
sw_4520_B_1012  A POINT OF REBELLION WHERE GUNS AS YOU MENTIONED BUT IN GENERAL IN CERTAIN AREAS I THINK IF I- IF THEY STARTED EARLIER MAYBE NOT IN JUST
sw_4520_B_1013  THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL BUT I MEAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MAYBE YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SWITCHBLADES INSTEAD OF GUNS
sw_4520_B_1014  THAT THE STUDENTS WOULD YOU KNOW IF THE TEACHERS GOT KIDS INTERESTED MORE INTO LEARNING RATHER THAN BICKERING YOU'D ELIMANATE THESE
sw_4520_B_1015  PSEUDO-REBEL ROLES THAT ARE CREATED
sw_4520_B_1016  BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF THE TEACHER SAYS DON'T DO THIS AND THEN KIDS DO IT AND ESPECIALLY THAT AGE THEY WANT TO BE A REBEL SO THEY'RE DIFFERENT THEY PROVE THEMSELVES BY YOU KNOW GOING AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT TYPE OF THING WHAT DO YOU THINK
sw_4520_B_1017  UH-HUH
sw_4520_B_1018  WHAT GRADE WERE YOU TEACHING
sw_4520_B_1019  OH REALLY
sw_4520_B_1020  W- GUNS AT THAT LEVEL TOO
sw_4520_B_1021  OKAY W- THIS IS IN NORTH CAROLINA
sw_4520_B_1022  OKAY
sw_4520_B_1023  UM-HUM
sw_4520_B_1024  UH-HUH
sw_4520_B_1025  REALLY DO YOU THINK THE PROBLEM MIGHT HAVE ORIGINATED AT AN EARLIER STAGE THAT MAYBE KIDS WEREN'T REALLY TAUGHT MUCH TO RESPECT YOU KNOW TEACHERS AND ALSO TRY TO GET INTERESTED
sw_4520_B_1026  UM-HUM
sw_4537_A_1000  WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER CAMPING

sw_4560_A_1013  IT- IT JUST DIDN'T KEEP THE HOUSE WARM AT ALL AND THE FAN HARDLY BLEW ANY AIR THROUGH THE HOUSE SO LIKE YOU I HAVE A- A- A STEPPED-UP FAN MOTOR NOW AND IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IT MAKES WITH THE NEW FURNACE
sw_4560_A_1014  YOU MEAN IN R P M I HAVE NO IDEA TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH THERE'S FOUR OR FIVE SETTINGS IN IT ACTUALLY WE HAD TO TURN IT DOWN TO ONE OF THE LOWER SETTINGS BECAUSE THE HIGHER SETTING DIDN'T KEEP DIDN'T LET THE FURNACE GET HOT ENOUGH TO WORK EFFICIENTLY
sw_4560_A_1015  THE AIR WASN'T ALL THAT HOT
sw_4560_A_1016  IT'S ON ONE OF THE LOWER SETTINGS WHICH IS STILL QUITE A BIT MORE THAN WHAT WE HAD BEFORE
sw_4560_A_1017  RIGHT
sw_4560_A_1018  YEAH

sw_4560_A_1032  OH OKAY
sw_4560_A_1033  OH THAT'S GOOD WELL THE LAST MAJOR THING WE DID OURSELVES WAS WE DECIDED TO REFINISH OUR BEDROOM
sw_4560_A_1034  W- TO REDO THE BEDROOM THE DOWNSTAIRS HAS ALL NATURAL WOOD TRIM BUT THE UPSTAIRS ALL THE WOODWORK WAS PAINTED WE DECIDED WE DIDN'T LIKE THAT
sw_4560_A_1035  SO WE THOUGHT WE'D GET AMBITIOUS AND STRIP ALL THE PAINT OFF OF THE WOODWORK AND HAD I KNOWN WHAT I WAS GETTING MYSELF INTO I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN TO DO THAT
sw_4560_A_1036  BUT WE STARTED IT SO WE FINISHED IT AND WE ALSO HAD TO TEAR ALL THIS OLD WALLPAPER OFF THE WALLS
sw_4560_A_1037  AND THAT WAS QUITE A MESS BUT IT- IT'S NICE BUT WE'RE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE AFTER GETTING ALL THE WOOD OFF THE PAINT OFF THE WOOD UPSTAIRS WE REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T THE SAME QUALITY WOOD
sw_4560_B_1000  WELL LET'S SEE
sw_4560_B_1001  THE LAST THING I WORKED ON WE'LL LET'S SEE
sw_4560_B_1002  I HAVEN'T DONE AN AWFUL LOT BECAUSE I JUST BOUGHT MY HOUSE HERE
sw_4560_B_1003  I'VE BEEN PLANNING ON DOING SOME WORK TO FIX UP SOME OF THE STUFF AROUND HERE AND I'VE BEEN REPAIRING SOME LIGHTS STUFF LIKE THAT
sw_4560_B_1004  NEED TO I NEED TO SEAL THE BACK DECK
sw_4560_B_1005  SINCE IT'S A A- A- W- THEY'VE ALLOWED IT TO GET A LITTLE BIT WEATHERBEATEN
sw_4560_B_1006  YEAH WELL IT- IT'S
sw_4560_B_1007  IT'S IT'LL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE BUT ONCE IT GETS A LITTLE BIT WARMER I'LL PROBABLY BE GOING INTO IT
sw_4560_B_1008  UM-HUM YEAH THE
sw_4560_B_1009  THE HOUSE WAS KEPT IN REASONABLY GOOD RE- REPAIR BY THE PEOPLE WHO WHO I BOUGHT IT FROM
sw_4560_B_1010  AND BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A A NUMBER OF THINGS TO DO I ALSO NEED TO DO SOME WORK WITH THE HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEM
sw_4560_B_1011  IT DOESN'T GET VERY GOOD AIRFLOW TO THE UPSTAIRS B- THEY DIDN'T DESIGN IT VERY WELL SO I HAVE TO PUT IN SOME FANS
sw_4560_B_1012  NO ACTUALLY IT'S PRE- IT'S FAIRLY NEW IT'S JUST THAT THEY DIDN'T D- THERE THERE JUST I- ISN'T ANY AIRFLOW TO THE UPSTAIRS BECAUSE OF BAD DUCTWORK DESIGN
sw_4560_B_1013  ALSO JUS- AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEY UPPED THE FAN RATE
sw_4560_B_1014  TO SOMETHING I- TO VERY VERY HIGH WHICH MAKES IT NOISY DOWNSTAIRS AND WEARS OUT THE BEARINGS SO I JUST HAD TO REPLACE THE BEARINGS LAST WEEKEND
sw_4560_B_1015  BECAUSE I HAD NO HEAT
sw_4560_B_1016  UM-HUM
sw_4560_B_1017  YEAH
sw_4560_B_1018  I HAD ONE OF THOSE AT MY PREVIOUS HOUSE

sw_4560_B_1023  YEAH
sw_4560_B_1024  YEAH M- MINE WAS TURNED UP TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED R P M NORMAL IS MORE LIKE YOU KNOW SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED
sw_4560_B_1025  SO IT GETS A LOT OF AIRFLOW DOWNSTAIRS BUT STILL ALMOST NOTHING UPSTAIRS IT'S NOT THAT BAD IN THE WINTER BECAUSE THE HEAT RISES
sw_4560_B_1026  BUT IN THE SUMMER F- WH- WHEN IT'S TIME FOR AIR CONDITIONING IT WON'T BE VERY HERE VERY EFFECTIVE
sw_4560_B_1027  SO I
sw_4560_B_1028  YEAH HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
sw_4560_B_1029  EITHER SOME WAY TO IMPROVE THE DUCTING OR S- TO PUT A BOOSTER FAN GOING TO THE UPSTAIRS
sw_4560_B_1030  THE BEARINGS HAD ON THIS HAD WORN OUT
sw_4560_B_1031  TO THE POINT WHERE
sw_4560_B_1032  AW
sw_4560_B_1033  IT WAS RATTLING AROUND RATHER RATHER BADLY AND FINALLY JUST THREW IT'S BELT OFF
sw_4560_B_1034  SO
sw_4560_B_1035  YEAH WELL IT'S NOT THAT BAD BECAUSE I CAN'T HEAR IT UPSTAIRS BUT THE IT'S IT'S
sw_4560_B_1036  IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T HEAR THE THE TELEVISON OR TALK
sw_4560_B_1037  OF- OR- OR WAS GETTING TO THAT POINT
sw_4560_B_1038  NO IT IT DOE- THE THE FURNACE DOES HAVE ENOUGH
sw_4560_B_1039  HEATING AND COOLING POWER TO- TO- SO THAT THE AIRFLOW ISN'T A PROBLEM THEN WHE- I HAD THE INSPECTOR
sw_4560_B_1040  CHECK THAT OUT AND IT WAS COOLING TH- COOLING THE AIR ADEQUATELY
sw_4560_B_1041  IT WAS JUST IT WAS ALL THE COOLING WAS GOING DOWNSTAIRS

sw_4580_A_1014  YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS A ANOTHER MILITARY ATTEMPTED COUP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT SEEMS LIKE A SEPARATE QUESTION FROM WHETHER OR NOT THE SOVIET UNION ITSELF IS STILL A THREAT TO THE U S BECAUSE
sw_4580_A_1015  NO SOVIET UNION I GUESS
sw_4580_A_1016  DEBATING ABOUT SEMANTICS

sw_4580_A_1033 
sw_4580_A_1034  YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
sw_4580_A_1035  ALL THESE MEASURES THAT SOUND SORT OF
sw_4580_A_1036  DOMESTIC I GUESS IF THERE WERE FURTHER EFFORTS AT DISARMAMENT OR ARMS CONTROL I G- THAT WOULD PROBABLY DECREASE THE THREAT AS WELL RIGHT

sw_4604_A_1005 
sw_4604_A_1006  YEAH
sw_4604_A_1007  YEAH WE JUST WROTE IT ON OUR SCHOOL BOARD BUDGET YESTERDAY
sw_4604_A_1008  IT PASSED IT HAD A TWO PERCENT INCREASE
sw_4604_A_1009  WHICH WAS YOU KNOW PRETTY MODEST COMPARED TO THE
sw_4604_A_1010  MUNICIPAL BUDGET THAT WENT UP ELEVEN PERCENT WIT-
sw_4604_A_1011  NO INCREASE IN SERVICES SO
sw_4604_A_1012  SCHOOL BOARD IS DOING A LITTLE BIT BETTER JOB THIS YEAR THAN THAT- THE TOWNSHIP ADMINISTRATION
sw_4604_A_1013  YEAH W- WE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST WE- I'M IN THE MORRIS SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR PER PUPIL EXPENDITURE WHICH IS I THINK
sw_4604_A_1014  ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE PER PUPIL THAN THE STATE AVERAGE
sw_4604_A_1015  BUT
sw_4604_A_1016  F- I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS IN SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION AND THEY ALL YOU KNOW TELL ME THAT
sw_4604_A_1017  THAT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED IS NOT OUT OF LINE CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE DISTRICT AND THE DIVERSITY OF THE POPULATION AND THE RICHNESS OF THE PROGRAMS AND EVERYTHING
sw_4604_A_1018  IN FACT ONE IN PARTICULAR IS TH- WAS THE BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR FOR RANDOLPH DISTRICT WHICH WAS LISTED BY ONE OF THE
sw_4604_A_1019  BY A MAGAZINE AS ONE OF THE TOP DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTRY
sw_4604_A_1020  AND THAT HE CHOSE TO LIVE IN MORRIS SCHOOL DISTRICT SO HE COULD HAVE HIS CHILD GO THERE SO THAT WAS A PRETT- PRETTY STRONG VOTE IN FAVOR OF OUR OF A- L- AT LEAST THAT PORTION OF OUR MONEY
sw_4604_A_1021  YEAH
sw_4604_A_1022  UM-HUM
sw_4604_A_1023  UM-HUM
sw_4604_A_1024  UM-HUM
sw_4604_A_1025  GETTING VALUE FOR THAT YEAH
sw_4604_A_1026  YEAH
sw_4604_A_1027  YEAH THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THE FRUSTRATING
sw_4604_A_1028  AREAS OF OF THIS TOPIC IS I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF PROBLEM WITH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TAX I PAY AND I HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT THAT IS F- BY THE WAY
sw_4604_A_1029  AS I'M SITTING HERE THINKING ABOUT IT I HAVE NO IDEA I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I END UP PAYING THIRTY PERCENT OR FIFTY PERCENT OF MY TOTAL WAGES IN TAXES WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK OF INCOME AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND STATE TAX AND
sw_4604_A_1030  AND LOCAL TAX AND THEN SALES TAX
sw_4604_A_1031  I SUSPECT IT'S YOU KNOW PRETT- PRETTY HIGH UP THERE FORTY FIFTY PERCENT
sw_4604_A_1032  BUT I MEAN MY STANDARD OF LIVING IS HIGH AND I YOU KNOW I GET POLICE PROTECTION AND GARBAGE PICKUP AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE DO I NEED
sw_4604_A_1033  WHAT I DON'T KNOW THOUGH IS IF THAT TAX MONEY IS BEING SPENT EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY
sw_4604_A_1034  AND I'M I'M SURE AS IN ANY BUSINESS THINGS COULD IMPROVE BUT I DON'T KNOW OVERALL WHETHER I'M GETTING FULL VALUE FOR THAT TAX DOLLAR
sw_4604_A_1035  I- I JUST D- I-
sw_4604_A_1036  I DON'T HAVE ANY F- WAY OF OF REALLY DETERMINING THAT UNLESS YOU GET INTO THE NITTY GRITTY OF A BUDGET AND SEE WHERE EVERY DOLLAR GOES
sw_4604_A_1037  HOW YOU GONNA KNOW
sw_4604_A_1038  YEAH
sw_4604_A_1039  YEAH
sw_4604_A_1040  I MEAN I
sw_4604_A_1041  YEAH JUST JUST A
sw_4604_A_1042  YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF ALMOST ANECDOTAL THINGS I KNOW NEW JERSEY HAS MORE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAN ANY OTHER STATE
sw_4604_A_1043  W- WHICH IS INCREDIBLE GIVEN OUR SIZE NOT ONLY THE POPULATION BUT THE DENSITY AND THE AND THE TERRITORY BUT WE HAVE MORE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ANY OTHER S-
sw_4604_B_1000  I'M IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY IN BERKELEY HEIGHTS R-
sw_4604_B_1001  OH REALLY
sw_4604_B_1002  YEAH
sw_4604_B_1003  WELL
sw_4604_B_1004  WELL I FEEL MY REAL ESTATE TAXES ARE EXHORBITANT
sw_4604_B_1005  AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS DUE TO SCHOOL TAXES
sw_4604_B_1006  FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND NEW JERSEY HAS THE HIGHEST EDUCATION COST PER PUPIL
sw_4604_B_1007  OVER THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES I THINK EVEN INCLUDING ALASKA WHERE YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE COST TO BE HIGHER
sw_4604_B_1008  AND I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO I THINK IT'S A L- LOT OF IT IS
sw_4604_B_1009  ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BECAUSE TEACHERS DON'T REALLY GET PAID ANY MORE THAN
sw_4604_B_1010  OTHER YOU KNOW STATES IN THE NORTHEAST
sw_4604_B_1011  BUT I THINK YOU GET ADMINISTRATORS I THINK WE'VE OVERLOADED WITH ADMINISTRATORS
sw_4604_B_1012  SO I THINK EDUCATION COSTS ARE REALLY ONE OF THE BIG EXPENSES IN NEW JERSEY AND AND
sw_4604_B_1013  YEAH
sw_4604_B_1014  OH REALLY
sw_4604_B_1015  YEAH
sw_4604_B_1016  YEAH I- I THINK THAT'S TRUE I THINK THE THEY HAVE STABILIZED THE THE SCHOOL BOARD COSTS
sw_4604_B_1017  OUR MUNICIPAL COSTS HAVE HAVE STABILIZED TOO BUT I THINK THEY'RE JUST ENORMOUS TO START OUT FROM
sw_4604_B_1018  REALLY YEAH

sw_4604_B_1021  YEAH WELL I HAVE NOTHING TO I-
sw_4604_B_1022  RIGHT THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION I THINK IS IS REASONABLY GOOD I JUST THINK WE'RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR IT MY WIFE HAPPENS TO BE A A LEARNING DISABILITIES CONSULTANT
sw_4604_B_1023  AND I GIVE HER A A LOT OF GRIEF BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE MANDATED BY THE STATE
sw_4604_B_1024  SHE DOES NO TEACHING SHE DOES A LOT OF PAPER WORK AND TRYING TO SCREEN PUPILS WHO NEED EXTRA HELP
sw_4604_B_1025  AND IT'S IT'S VERY LABOR INTENSIVE AND A LOT OF PAPERWORK AND I- I- I OFTEN WONDER WHETHER THERE WE'RE
sw_4604_B_1026  WE'RE REALLY GETTING OUR MONEY'S WORTH FOR FOR HELPING THESE STUDENTS I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE HELPED IN SOME WAY BUT I'M I'M I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER THE PROCESS IS REALLY EFFICIENT AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT WE'RE REALLY PAYING FOR
sw_4604_B_1027  UM-HUM

sw_4689_B_1011  HAVING THAT PERSONAL TIME WITH PARENTS WHEN THERE'S NOBODY ELSE INTERFERING
sw_4689_B_1012  AND WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE FAMILY THAT'S KIND OF HARD TO SPEND A- INDIVIDUAL TIME WITH EACH CHILD BUT

sw_4689_B_1034  CAN AND AND HAVE SOME GOOD QUALITY TIME WITH THEM AND IT'S STILL IT'S STILL OKAY IT'S THE CHILDREN THAT COME HOME TO EMPTY HOUSES THAT WORRY ME

sw_4824_A_1010  UM-HUM
sw_4824_A_1011  RIGHT
sw_4824_A_1012  WELL WE'RE OPENING A ONE CAR THAT WE WERE THINKING OF GETTING THIS POINT IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE AND ARE THINKING OF SELLING THE CAR WE HAVE
sw_4824_A_1013  WHICH ISN'T WORTH ALL THAT MUCH AND AND BUYING A NEW ONE
sw_4824_A_1014  AND IF WE DID THAT
sw_4824_A_1015  WE'VE SEVERAL TIMES RENTED SOMETHING LIKE A CHEVY CORSICA
sw_4824_A_1016  AND THOUGHT ABOUT BUYING A AN EIGHTY NINE CORSICA OR SOMETHING BECAUSE WE COULD ABOUT AFFORD THAT BASED ON WHAT
sw_4824_A_1017  WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY MORE THAT WHAT WE COULD SELL OUR CURRENT CAR FOR
sw_4824_A_1018 
sw_4824_A_1019  MAINLY WE'RE NOT REAL FUSSY PEOPLE AND ANYWAY WE WANT SOME S- BASIC FEATURES LIKE AIR CONDITIONING AND AND AND SPACE YOU KNOW HEADROOM IS IS SOMEWHAT IMPORTANT
sw_4824_A_1020  AND
sw_4824_A_1021  OTHER THAN THAT
sw_4824_A_1022  WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING PRIMARILY AT PRICE AND POTENTIAL RELIABILITY
sw_4824_A_1023  AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE ABOUT THE SATURN IS THAT
sw_4824_A_1024  IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS THEY'VE S- THEY'VE BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT FIXING THEM
sw_4824_A_1025 
sw_4824_A_1026  YEAH

sw_4824_A_1034  AND
sw_4824_A_1035  I SORT OF FEEL L- THAT WHILE BUYING AN AMERICAN E- CAR WHATEVER THAT MEANS THESE DAYS MAY NOT HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY
sw_4824_A_1036  SENDING A SIGNAL T- T- TO SATURN THAT THAT THERE'RE PEOPLE WHO WHO THINK THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THE RIGHT THING
sw_4824_A_1037  MIGHT BE USEFUL ON A ON A SOMEWHAT SMALLER SCALE IT WOULDN'T OVERCOME A COUPLE OF THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF DIFFERENCE IN PRICE FOR THE SAME FEATURES THOUGH
sw_4824_A_1038  CONSUMER REPORTS
sw_4824_A_1039  YEAH WE SAW THAT AND AND THEY WERE VERY HIGHLY THOUGHT OF AND WHAT SURPRISED ME IS THAT THE CAR WAS PEPPIER THAN
sw_4824_A_1040  THE COMPETITION
sw_4824_A_1041  UH-HUH
sw_4824_A_1042  BUT
sw_4824_A_1043  UM-HUM

sw_4824_A_1046  THAT YO- YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GET
sw_4824_A_1047  POWER DOOR LOCKS YOU ALSO HAVE TO GO WITH WINDOWS AND MIRRORS AND AIR CONDITIONING
sw_4824_B_1000  I BOUGHT A NINETY TWO HONDA CIVIC I WAS LOOKING MORE FOR A SMALLER TYPE CAR
sw_4824_B_1001  SO IT WAS BETWEEN THE THE HONDA CIVIC AND THE SATURNS
sw_4824_B_1002  REALLY
sw_4824_B_1003  UM-HUM
sw_4824_B_1004  TH- THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE SATURN IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THE CIVIC HAD STUFF THE SATURN DIDN'T HAVE LIKE THE AIRBAG
sw_4824_B_1005  AND JUST GENERALLY MORE FEATURES FOR FOR THE MONEY
sw_4824_B_1006  I THOUGHT THE SATURN WAS A GOOD CAR EXCEPT THAT IT N- THERE WAS IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE TO GET SOME OF THE FEATURES
sw_4824_B_1007  BUT
sw_4824_B_1008  RIGHT THE AIRBAG WE- I GUESS YOU COULD AL- YOU COULD ALSO BUY THINGS LIKE ELECTRIC LOCKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
sw_4824_B_1009  YEAH I GUESS YOU COU- IF YOU WANTED TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA ONES THEN SURE YOU KNOW YOU COULD ALWAYS STICK THEM ON BUT THE COST WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATER
sw_4824_B_1010  FOR THE SATURN AND TH- THE TRACK RECORD FOR THE SATURN WAS UNPROVEN
sw_4824_B_1011  WHAT OTHER CARS ARE YOU CONSIDERING
sw_4824_B_1012  UM-HUM

sw_4824_B_1045  AND AND THE CIVIC WELL THE
sw_4824_B_1046  THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT JAPANESE CARS IN GENERAL IS
